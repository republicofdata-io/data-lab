# Data Lab Release 01 - Go! - Execution Plan

## Release Reference

**PKM Source:** [[2. 📦 Products/Data Lab/Releases/01 - Go!/Data Lab - Release 01 - Go.md]]
**Entity:** Data Lab
**Release:** 01 - Go!
**Status:** Active

---

## Quick Summary

**Problem:** RepublicOfData.io readers consume content passively—the gap between reading about a technique and actually implementing it remains unbridged.

**Solution:** Data Lab is a collection of Google Colab notebooks providing hands-on tutorials, integrated into Data Report via "Data Lab" callouts.

**Appetite:** Small Batch (1-2 weeks)

---

## Deliverables

### Must-Have

- [ ] Colab notebook template (reusable structure for Data Lab tutorials)
- [ ] First pilot tutorial (tied to a real Data Report story)
- [ ] Editorial integration ("Data Lab" callout format defined and documented)
- [ ] GitHub repo structure (`data-lab` with README)

### Nice-to-Have

- [ ] Data Lab landing page on republicofdata.io listing all tutorials

## Progress Tracking

### Current Phase

**Phase:** Phase 1: Repository Structure
**Progress:** Speckit workflow in progress for `001-repo-structure` feature

### Completed Work

- Constitution ratified (v1.0.0) - Core principles: Zero Friction, Tutorial Quality, Editorial Integration, Simplicity
- Feature `001-repo-structure` fully specified, planned, and tasked

### In Progress

- `001-repo-structure`: 17 tasks generated, ready for implementation
  - Spec: `specs/001-repo-structure/spec.md`
  - Plan: `specs/001-repo-structure/plan.md`
  - Tasks: `specs/001-repo-structure/tasks.md`

## Blockers & Risks

| Blocker/Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|--------------|--------|------------|--------|
| Tutorial maintenance burden | Libraries update, notebooks break silently | Pin library versions; focus on stable tools; set quarterly review cadence | Open |
| Low engagement | Readers ignore tutorials | Start with 1-2 tutorials to test demand | Open |
| Content bottleneck | Not every story has obvious hands-on angle | Be selective—tutorials for 1-2 sections per report max | Open |

---

## Technical Context

### Stack
- Google Colab (notebooks)
- GitHub (storage)
- Substack (analytics via Data Report)
- Markdown (callout integration)

### Dependencies
- Google Colab free tier availability
- Substack link tracking functionality
- GitHub repo creation (`data-lab`)

### No-Gos (from pitch)
- No paywalled tutorials
- No external dependencies beyond Google
- No complex prerequisites—must be "click and run"
